My name is Xu Jiale, and I am a student from Class 2 of the 2024 cohort majoring in Computer Science and Technology (Data Science Direction) at Lanzhou University.​
In my academic life, I study earnestly and strive for excellence, completing both in-class and after-class assignments to a high standard. I take the initiative to acquire knowledge, never shy away from challenges, and continuously hone my skills.​
I excel at communication and collaboration. In team projects, I can work efficiently with team members, listen attentively to various ideas, leverage my strengths, and jointly overcome difficulties. Additionally, I possess strong learning and adaptability skills, enabling me to quickly grasp new technologies, knowledge, or adapt to new working environments.​
In my daily life, I have a passion for badminton and have joined the Badminton Team of the School of Information. This sport has not only bestowed upon me a healthy body and a positive mindset but also enriched my life and cultivated qualities such as focus and perseverance.​
